	<h1>Course Retrospective Final Project</h1>
	<p>Throughout the assignments that I have completed for WRA 110 this semester, I have blossomed not only as a writer, but as a reader and editor as well. My coding skills have been enhanced to levels I never before thought possible and my excitement to delve into the world that is computing is at an all-time high. Even with that being said, my enthusiasm for this class was not always on par with what it is now. It took me a while to adapt to the style of teaching as well as project content to be able to appreciate this course to its full extent.</p>
	<p>The first project we were given was the Lived Experiences project. This was by far my favorite only because of how entertaining it was for me to write it at the time. I chose to write about my high school newspaper class, my budding love for graphic design, and the death of my long-time adviser and friend. My biggest regret for this project was the lack of thought that I put into the topic. Although my experiences on my high school newspaper were some of the defining moments that molded me into who I am today, the technological skills that I acquired during my time with the paper were subpar and I spent far too much for the paper discussing the tumultuous emotional journey I had endured with my teacher opposed to sticking to what the criteria of the project requested of me.</p>
<p>Another thing I would change about my execution of this paper was how badly I procrastinated it. Procrastination is a recurring theme for me throughout school work and it has been for the majority of my time spent in the educational system. As of late, I have been able to suppress the temptations proposed by procrastinating but the papers in this class, specifically this one, brought out the worst in me at the time. This was due to the lack of research (hold the research paper) that was necessary for each assignment. I found that waiting until the last minute was plausible and it was very evident in my work. One piece of advice that I would provide incoming WRA students with would definitely be to begin the work significantly ahead of time. The fact that the class only takes place once a week helped in me placing said projects on the back burner simply because they had not been refreshed in my memory over the course of the 7 day period between when we met. Planning accordingly would have helped my grade in countless ways, not only for better content but for better structure and execution. </p>
<p>That being said, the Lived Experiences paper over-all is the work I am most proud of from this course. After my completion of this paper, I realized its importance in the grand scheme of the class; it represented my willingness to learn along with how well I’ve adapted to new forms of technology in the past. It showed how I would adjust to the programs that we used in the class such as Codecademy and Github, both which I will return to address later.</p>
<p>The next project that we were assigned was the Cultural Analysis Project. This interested me a lot simply because we had the ability to not only voice our opinion to the audience but to write about something that actually effected society as well as our generation. It’s rare in a college course to be able to write about something that genuinely intrigues you as well as being given the opportunity to share your opinion on the topic at hand. This empowered me in the sense that I felt as though I could potentially sway my readers’ opinions and make a difference – even if my only audience was my peer editors and professor.</p>
<p>I wrote about pop culture’s effect on underage alcohol consumption and found the topic to be profound enough that I was able to cover a lot of material while simultaneously narrowed down to the point in which my material wasn’t too broad or overwhelming. I recommend that future students do a similar job of choosing a topic. It’s important that your topic is extensive enough that there are multiple angles that can be taken, sources that can be referenced and points that can be discussed. Simultaneously you must be sure to not choose a topic so far-reaching that you cannot fully cover all aspects of it. Finding a solid balance can make choosing a topic slightly more difficult but fruitful in long run when you aren’t spending your time scrambling to find more information or struggling to not go over the word limit.</p>
<p>The Formal Research Project was by far my greatest struggle. In relationship to my earlier comment about procrastinating, this project is by far the most relevant. Waiting until the last minute for completion is extremely evident in the end result and only serves to hurt yourself in the long run as the research for this project was significantly more extensive than it had been for previous projects. One important aspect of this project was the interviews that had to be conducted with experts and peers. Yet again this posed a difficulty for me being my inner procrastinator and left me with few last-minute options. The interviews could easily make or break this assignment as with solid quotes and interesting vantage points, the paper could easily be made significantly better. Doing the interviews far in advance and with reliable, respectable counterparts is definitely a must for this assignment, as with any other.</p>
<p>Along with that, I did not find the topic as entertaining as I had both previous assignments which made my execution of this project much more lackluster. Easily with more focus and a larger time-commitment I could have produced a more insightful, powerful project. I recommend that all future students be extra careful with time management with this project because it is the key to a successful report.</p>
<p>Finally there was the Multimedia Remix Project which was another somewhat difficult project for me. Most of the problems here though stemmed from an uncooperative, unmotivated group who did their best to push responsibilities off on others or just avoid them all together. One of the biggest issues that I had with this course was the fact that we never had the ability to pick our own groups. Choosing our own partners would have undoubtedly avoided a lot of conflict and miscommunication in the long run as well as made the groups more comfortable to work with. Going into this project not only was I not familiar with any of my fellow group members, we all had extremely conflicting schedules. On top of that, some members used said schedules as an excuse to avoid putting their fair share into their project, leading to even more difficulties that were easily avoidable if we simply were given the ability to decide our own groups. Otherwise this project was also very interesting as working with other forms of media was enlightening and an insightful learning experience. </p>
<p>The Codecademy was significantly more fun than I had anticipated and it answered several questions about HTML and other coding that I didn’t even know that I had. At the beginning of the semester we were told that waiting until the last minute to complete this would be a pain and difficult, which in most scenarios I would whole-heartedly agree with, but Codecademy was different. I say that because each section is closely related to the point where sometimes when I left off in a random spot and returned a week later, I couldn’t recall what I had learned during my previous work and that information was crucial in completing more. I recommend completing the Codecademy in the allotted sections but spreading those various sections throughout the semester. I would say to do the blogs similarly by doing one every week in the time provided at the end of class. You’re already in the room and most likely logged onto a computer, so completing the blog really is not much of an inconvenience and you’ll definitely think yourself later.</p>
<p>Overall my biggest tip for newcomers to this course is to not be afraid to ask questions. Although the rubrics go far into depth and the sites are quite simple once you learn the ropes, the first few lectures could be confusing due to the all of the unfamiliar programs. Technology based courses are rare so entering one was a very unique experience that I was unaccustomed to and even if at times I felt annoying asking multiple questions, it’s the only way to affectively gather all the information necessary to run the programs and be successful in this course.</p>
<p>In summation, I enjoyed WRA 110 significantly more than I anticipated in the beginning of the semester. Although it can seem overwhelming at times, the course was an eye-opener for me in many aspects and I genuinely enjoyed it come the end of the term. I recommend it for incoming freshman as a solid, interesting yet not-overly time consuming course that can provide a lot of insight to the world of computers and technology. </p>
